Location of California in the United States 

California is a state located on the West Coast of the United States. It is the most populous U.S. state and the third largest by area after Alaska and Texas. According to the 2010 United States Census, California has 37,253,956 inhabitants and 155,779.22 square miles (403,466.3 km2) of land.[1] It is home to major cities such as Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco.

California has been inhabited by numerous Native American peoples since antiquity. The Spanish, the Russians, and other Europeans began exploring and colonizing the area in the 16th and 17th centuries, with the Spanish establishing a mission at what is now San Diego in 1769.[2] After being ceded to the United States in 1848, the California Gold Rush brought worldwide attention to the area. With the growth of the movie industry in Los Angeles, the tech industry in Silicon Valley, tourism, and other sectors throughout the state, California is a $1.85 trillion economic powerhouse, with an economy larger than all but eight countries.[3]

California consists of 58 counties and contains 482 municipalities. California law makes no distinction between "city" and "town," and municipalities may adopt either term in their official names.[4] According to the 2010 Census, 30,908,614 of California's 37,253,956 residents lived in municipalities, accounting for 82.97% of the population. The first municipality to incorporate was Sacramento on February 27, 1850, while the most recent was Jurupa Valley on October 1, 2011.[5] The largest municipality by population and land area is Los Angeles with 3,792,621 residents and 468.67 square miles (1,213.8 km2). The smallest by population is Vernon with 112 people, while the smallest by land area is Amador City at 0.31 square miles (0.80 km2).[1]
